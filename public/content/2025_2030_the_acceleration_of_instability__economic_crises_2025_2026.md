## What’s Happening?

### Debt Defaults
- **Sovereign Debt Overload**: Several developing nations (e.g., Sri Lanka, Turkey) face overwhelming debt burdens, struggling to meet repayment schedules.  
- **Global Financial Contagion**: In a tightly interconnected financial system, defaults in one region can trigger panic and reverberate worldwide.

### Stock Market Crash
- **Major Institutional Collapse**: A high-profile financial institution goes under, shaking investor confidence and causing a cascading sell-off in equities.  
- **Widespread Pension Losses**: Retirement funds are heavily exposed to equity markets, leading to significant erosion of savings.

## Evidence & Trends

- **Ballooning Debt-to-GDP Ratios**: Data from organizations like the IMF and World Bank show a trend of rising debt in emerging markets, often exceeding 100% of GDP.  
- **Corporate Leverage**: Large corporations increasingly rely on borrowing at low interest rates; when rates rise or liquidity dries up, defaults spike.  
- **Market Volatility Indicators**: Metrics like the VIX (“fear index”) frequently spike during episodes of political or economic uncertainty, foreshadowing potential crashes.  
- **Financial Instability**: Historical parallels (e.g., 2008 global financial crisis) suggest that highly leveraged financial institutions can collapse suddenly, with cascading effects.
