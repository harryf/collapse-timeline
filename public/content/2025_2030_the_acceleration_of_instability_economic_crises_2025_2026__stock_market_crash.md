## What’s Happening ?
A major financial institution collapses—whether through risky lending, overleveraging, or systemic mismanagement—leading to a sudden crisis of confidence in global equity markets. Stock indices plummet by 30–40%, wiping out trillions in market value. Retirement portfolios and pension funds, heavily invested in equities, take catastrophic losses, threatening the financial security of millions of individuals and families worldwide.

## Evidence & Trends
- **High Leverage**: Banks and hedge funds rely on complex financial instruments (e.g., derivatives, collateralized debt) that amplify gains—and losses—during market swings.  
- **Global Interdependence**: Contagion spreads quickly through interconnected financial systems. One major default can cause margin calls, liquidity shortages, and panic selling.  
- **Historical Precedent**: The 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers demonstrated how a single institution’s failure can destabilize global markets.  
- **Pension Exposure**: Many pension funds have increased their equity holdings to chase higher returns in low-interest-rate environments, leaving retirees vulnerable to sudden downturns.
