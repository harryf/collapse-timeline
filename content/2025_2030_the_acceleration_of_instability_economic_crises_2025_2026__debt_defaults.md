## What’s Happening?
Developing nations like Sri Lanka and Turkey are failing to meet their sovereign debt obligations due to high borrowing costs, currency devaluation, and weak fiscal balances. As these countries default or approach default, global investors lose confidence, and the resulting panic can spread across interconnected financial markets. This sparks broader instability, making it more expensive and difficult for other emerging economies to roll over their own debts.

## Evidence & Trends
- **High Debt-to-GDP Ratios**: International Monetary Fund (IMF) data shows many emerging economies exceed 80-100% debt-to-GDP, putting them at higher risk of default.
- **Rising Global Interest Rates**: As developed nations increase their rates, developing economies face higher borrowing costs, accelerating debt-servicing challenges.
- **Currency Crises**: Devaluation of local currencies (e.g., Turkish lira) amplifies the burden of dollar-denominated debt.
- **Investor Flight to Safety**: Fears of defaults prompt capital outflows from emerging markets and into more stable assets, increasing volatility in currencies and bonds.
